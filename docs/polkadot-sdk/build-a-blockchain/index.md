# Build a Blockchain

The **Build a Blockchain** tutorials illustrate the basics for working with Substrate-based blockchain nodes, including:

- Making nodes communicate in a peer network
- Collecting metrics about node operations

:::tip Tutorial Order
Complete the tutorials in order as they build foundational knowledge for more complex tasks. Later tutorials reinforce and expand on basic concepts.

# Tutorials

- [Build a local blockchain](./build-local-blockchain.md) shows you how to set up and interact with a local node in your development environment.
- [Simulate a network](./simulate-network.md) helps you simulate a two-node network using predefined accounts.
- [Add trusted nodes](./add-trusted-nodes.md) demonstrates how to generate keys and distribute a chain specification to create a small network of trusted validator nodes.
- [Authorize specific nodes](./authorize-specific-nodes.md) illustrates how you can configure a network that has both authorized nodes and nodes with restricted access.
- [Monitor node metrics](./monitor-node-metrics.md) highlights how you can take advantage of the node metrics Substrate exposes.
- [Upgrade a running network](./upgrade-a-running-network.md) illustrates forkless upgrades by modifying the runtime for a running Substrate node.
